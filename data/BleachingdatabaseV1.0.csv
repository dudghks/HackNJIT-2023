Porifera (sponge) Aplysina spp . Spheciospongia vesparia Xestospongia muta;: Hydrozoa (fire coral) Millepora alcicornis; 
Scleractinia (hard coral) Acropora cervicornis Agaricia agaricites Diploria strigosa Montastrea annularis Montastrea cavernosa Porites porites; Gorgonacea (soft coral) several unidentified species.

Coral bleaching occurred at Lee Stocking Island following a short period (18 days) of daily average water temperatures above 30 .5`C on the bank in July-August 1990 followed by another temperature peak in mid-September. A maximum temperature of 32.5C was reached on 23 September 1990 . The July monthly average for 1990 did not differ from surrounding years, but August and September were significantly wanner in 1990. The 5-yr record at the LSI dock distinctly shows a longer-term maxima in 1990.",,1

By 21 Aug 1996 mean SST in Kaneohe Bay reached 28.5 C and was increasing rapidly. Wind speed dropped to a low level.  Solar radiation input was at near annual maximum with little cloud cover. Corals throughout the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay began to show signs of stress including contracted polyps, mucous secretion and some discoloration. Maximum mid-day temperature on the reef began to exceed 30 C starting on 26 Aug
1996. By 31 August 1996 the daily mean SST exceeded 30 C with a daily mid day maximum approaching 30.7 C.  By this time the bleaching process was conspicuously underway in corals throughout the inner portion of the bay.  Corals in the lagoon area directly in front of the main building of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology experienced higher temperatures due to restricted circulation and were highly bleached by 26 August 1996. Large tracts of corals throughout the inshore portion of Kaneohe Bay became highly bleached by 4 September. The areas where significant amounts of bleaching occurred were confined to the inner portion of Kaneohe Bay. The proportion of coral heads that bleached throughout the affected area varied from less than 5% in some areas to 100% over large sections of reef.  The amount of bleaching diminished near stream discharge points or other areas where turbidity was high.  Bleaching decreased with depth, especially in localized areas of high turbidity.  
The period of highest thermal stress occurred between 14 August and 5 September (22 days).  During this time period the mean daily temperature remained in the 29-30 C  range.  The corals became progressively more bleached throughout September even  though temperature was declining.  Maximum bleaching occurred from 2 to 4 weeks  after the peak of highest temperature.  A second less severe warming episode  developed in early October, but peak temperature remained below 29 C and did  not appear to further increase the rate of bleaching.  By mid October  temperatures diminished into the normal range and recovery of bleached  corals was underway.  Corals that were only slightly bleached started to regain pigmentation.  The remaining zooxanthellae in the lower shaded portions of bleached colonies began to rapidly re-infect the upper surface bleached areas.  Corals that were highly bleached died or regained pigment very slowly.
Most of the colonies throughout the bay had recovered by mid November.  Some of the highly bleached colonies  still were white in color in late November, but regained full pigment by the end of December 1996.",,1

However, after high wind intensities and coastal upwelling caused further sea surface temperature reductions during autumn 1998, we observed widespread bleaching in the reef tract, but mortality only occurred in the two most northern reefs of the area: Tijera and Mazunte. Pocillopora was the most affected genus, although Pavona and Porites were impacted, too. In normal years, northern winds cross the Gulf of MŽxico and increase their speed when passing through the Tehuantepec Isthmus. They displace surface water and produce strong upwellings that affect an area of about 200X500 km in the Gulf of Tehuantepec.",,1

The reduction in percent corals bleached at all depths over the first year of observation was dramatic (live coral cover fell from a maximum of 80% for all depths to between 0 and 10% in 1999). Around Danjugan, these areas were dominated by colonies of branching Acropora spp. and Seriatopora hystrix. 
Initially, an average of around 80% of corals from all depths were bleached at Hilarys Reef. Corals that bleached were dominated by P. clavus in the shallow depths of Hilarys Reef.

NOAA Bleaching Report Page http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/orad/sub/bleaching_report_index.html",,,"Acropora colonies (staghorn corals) are mainly affected although there is a general whitening of most species. 
The corals showing the next greatest effect are the bushy species such as Pocillopora, Stylophora and Seriatopora.(Hoegh-Guldberg, O. et al.)

Coral bleaching was observed with about 7% of corals bleached. 
Observed maximum water temperture was 28.2 deg C.
Bleaching was most extensive at intermediate depths of the upper 
slope, at 3-6m, compared to shallower upper slope and reef flat. 
Acropora cervicorn was most severely affected, followed by 
A. nobilis, A. formosa, A. yongei, A. abrolhosensis.
Partial bleaching of corals was observed in the intertidal lagoon. 
A. palifera, A. millepora, and several montiporiids were affected.
Bleaching of other corals was rare. 
Extensive turbidity was observed during the bleaching event which 
was not observed at near-by One tree Island where bleaching was 
minimal.  Algal blooms were extensive in patches of staghorn acroporids 0.5-2m depth at upper slope. These were severely bleached in 1998. 
Bleaching was in 'recovery' phase, i.e. Bleached colonies were 
recovering their color, measured photosynthetic yeilds were 
reduced compared to unbleached corals, but were not as low as in 
bleached corals (Fv/Fm 0.4-0.65). (A. Salih, 26/2/2002).

The amount of bleaching has increased during the past few weeks 
- perhaps due to the ""maturing"" of previous damage and/or added 
insult from low tides in the middle of the day.  The final analysis 
indicates something like 60-70% of corals in the intertidal being
completely bleached with mortality running at around 20%.  Off the 
reef crest - most sites are bleached to about 20-30% down to 10 m.  
Bleaching is noticeably greater closer to Gladstone (seen from the 
air as your fly by Heli to Gladstone) (Hoegh-Guldberg, 20/3/2002)",,1

This led to some bleaching at a national scale, principally of the genus Acropora corals, but only in shallow waters. Shallow areas (2-4m) in which the CCC Fiji data is derived showed 5 % of coral colonies of the genus Acropora having been bleached. There was also one large area of Acropora coral at 14 m near Sunflower reef where a 15 m2 area was bleached, but only the apical portions of the colonyÕs branches. Other than this small percent of bleached coral and the deeper bleaching at Sunflower, there appeared to be little overall impact of the bleaching in the Mamanucas for April-May 2002.

Bleaching started in 8/11/2002.
Fringe coral reefs, typical for the area are located in very shallow water 1.5-2 m depth. Only single Montipora colonies and small staghorn acroporids reefs (lesser than 5 % of all coral reef area) are located at 3-4 m depth. This year bleaching has not been related to the Òhot spotÓ development in the area like this have happened in November 2001. Surface water temperature has reached coral bleaching threshold according to SST (http://orbit-net.nesdis.noaa.gov/orad/sub/sst_series_cobourg_cur.html), but no hot spots have been discovered in the area.Temperature  measurements made in situ showed no temperature increase beyond 28 o C at 1 meter depth. However, shallow reefs have been almost  completely exposed to the sun heat during low spring tide hours which happened at midday hours four time: at he beginning and the end of November 2002, and at the beginning and the end of December 2002. Water remaining in temporal pools and depressions sometimes was reaching temperature of 40 o C  and more. Each low spring period that fell on midday time lasted for at least three hours and had happening for 6-7 days. Eventually, our coral reefs have been exposed to the direct sun  heat for at least 72 hours. All these coincided with very hot weather without wind, intensive solar radiations and absence of clouds. Moderate to large swings towards warmer than average daytime temperatures was also apparent in the north of  Australia according to Australian National Climate Centre. Monsoon was delayed for at least a month.As a result,  100 percent  of all coral colonies got bleached. Solitary corals colonies and staghorn acroporids reefs located   at the depth of 3-4 meters have been also affected by bleaching. Coral reefs condition assessment was done in the end of January after ~ 3 weeks non-stop storm and rain which brought water temperature down to 27.5-28 o C . At the date 13 February ~ 80% of corals still remain bleached. About 30 % of coral colonies (mostly tabular  Acropora are dead and covered with filament algae.",,1

Bleaching is mild to moderate rather than severe; colonies are ÔpalingÕ, and all shades of colour from normal to white are observed. In Kenya, most paling and bleaching is on upper surfaces, and the coincidence of high temperatures, calm conditions and spring low tides just prior to bleaching suggest combined effects of these factors rather than an overwhelming dominance of one.
The spatial extent of paling and bleaching amounts to perhaps 10-20% of coral cover and 5-25% or colonies, with most observations made in shallow inner-reef zones (water depth of 0.3-1m at MLW).  
Most detail on taxonomic incidence of bleaching has come from reports in Kenya, where the most affected genus is Pocillopora, where locally close to 100% of colonies have been observed bleached, and some colonies observed with dead patches (primarily around the branch tips). Interestingly, P. damicornis is less affected than other species, and in one shallow reef flat area is unaffected.

This is true of the places with open circulation as well as the closed circulation areas.",,Doug Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral-list@coral.aoml.noaa.gov 30/3/2004 and personal communication to ReefBase.,,,"A mild coral bleaching event is currently underway in American Samoa.  About 1/4 to 3/4 of living staghorns are at least partially bleached in 3 lagoons on Tutuila.  Only upper surfaces of horizontal branches have any bleaching (usually it is only partial even on upper surfaces); undersides always retain some color.  No colonies are totally bleached, none recently dead.  A few A. palifera and A. cf. listeri are bleached, but there are very few colonies of these species in the lagoons.  Other species are not bleached.  Bleaching was first seen on March 20.  The last previous check of these corals was on Feb 28.
     Temperature loggers in one lagoon show temperatures rising to a peak averaging a little over 30C in mid-February, and remaining fairly steady since then.  Peak temperatures reach 32C for a few hours on some days.  These 3 lagoons have little water circulating into them at low tide.  25-75% of staghorns in the more closed lagoons are bleached.  Similar areas with the same staghorns that have open circulation with the ocean have very little bleaching (about 1-5%).  Reef fronts that have been looked at also have no bleaching, but do not have these staghorns.
    I am told that last year there was strong bleaching of the staghorns, and there was bleaching in the previous summer as well.

Records from temperature loggers show that the sea surface temperature in American Samoa was heating up in December and early January.  When Hurricane Heta hit on Jan 6, 2004 it caused a sudden large drop in sea surface temperatures, most likely due to wave mixing of surface waters with cooler deeper water.  After Jan 6, sea surface temperature began to warm again, starting at a new lower base.  So in effect, Hurricane Heta reset the summer warming of surface waters.  Presumably then the maximum temperatures that were reached were lower than they would have been otherwise, and bleaching was more mild than it would have been otherwise.  Normal summer bleaching here may be closer to that experienced in the previous two summers, when mass bleaching of perhaps 20-30% of corals on reef slopes was followed by the death of some table corals on slopes and some staghorns and fire coral in lagoons.",,1

The observations were taken in three different locations within the atoll's lagoon (no observations taken on the fore reef) during repeated benthic transects.  That genus is already found in low numbers within Glovers due to its slow recovery after Hurricane Mitch in '98 and various other bleaching events.  In an odd twist, I did some work at the Brooklyn Aquarium (WCS) in the coral culture lab in May and noted bleaching
among our Acropora samples just before I left.  Even samples in SEPARATE tanks were showing the same bleaching trends.  Not sure if there is a correlation, but an interesting observation none the less.",,1

Perhaps this is related to the ""hotspot"" to the south.  While this sort of shallow bleaching (upper half meter or less) is not unusual (we had similar bleaching in 2000, 2002 and 2004) what is novel is the season; previous bleachings were limited to the autumn (Sept-Nov) when maximal temperatures occur.  A week later (Feb. 20) a dive computer gave a temp. reading of 84 F at the surface and 82 F 10 meters down.  This bleaching is on the southern leeward shore, sheltered from the tradewinds, during a period of calm condition (i.e., minimal swell).",,1

CORDIO online document",,,"Minor coral bleaching was observed on the 26th March 2005 among the reef crests of shallow coral banks of the Bar Reef Marine Sanctuary. The depth varied between 1 and 2m. Below is a table of the species affected and the degree to which they were bleached. It was noted that all the colonies of affected species were not bleached. <br>
Species affected and Level of bleaching<br>
Leptoria phrygia - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Favia pallida - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Favia favus - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Platygyra daedalea - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Hydnophora microconos - Partial bleaching (mainly on upper surfaces of colonies)<br>
Symphyllia radians - Partial bleaching<br> 
Pocillopora damicornis - Some branch tips only<br>
Acropora muricata (formally A. formosa) - 2 small colonies totally bleached<br>
Montipora foliosa - Edges of whorls bleached<br>
In this location there are many table corals (Acropora cytherea) that have come up after the 1998 coral bleaching event, which destroyed almost all corals in these shallow coral patches. No signs of bleaching were observed on Acropora cytherea. 2 small colonies of Acropora muricata about 25 cm high were completely bleached. Bleached massive coral colonies were relatively small (about 30 cm across or less). Partial bleaching was observed on massive corals. <br>
In the latter half of March 2005 the temperature on land was relatively high with humidity 90% or higher. The sea surface temperature was not measured where the bleaching was observed. <br>
Since 31st of March 2005 the weather on the west coast has changed to pre-monsoon. This means that there is SW winds and rain. If the rainy weather continues it might save the corals from further bleaching.
Minor coral bleaching was reported from SL last year too, from Trincomalee in the East coast and Rumassala reef in the south.",,1

genera showing pale tissue include Porites, Platygyra, Echinopora, Galaxea,
Goniopora, Astreopora, Montipora and Hydnophora (one individual only).
Acropora species at the site are all normal, and have only been affected by

Colombia,Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park),,10.1670,-75.7670,6,2005,,-1,,0,"Most corals are still alive. I only noticed a few branches of Millepora and portions of colonies of Porites astreoides with a slimy greenish-brownish layer, indicative of initial cyano or algal colonization after coral tissue death. But if most corals bleached 2 weeks ago and are still all alive, we may expect recovery.<br>",Snorkling,Alberto Rodriguez [betorod@invemar.org.co] on behalf of Sven Zea (szea@invemar.org.co; sezeas@unal.edu.co) in Coral List 7/14/2005,,,"A massive bleaching of corals is taking place since aprox 10-15 days (since late June) at Islas del Rosario (National Natural Park) near the city of Cartagena, Colombia. I was there on holidays during the weekend of 8-10 July and took many photos in shallow waters (down to 5 m) around the Oceanarium at San Mart’n de Pajarales Island (10¡10'37.7""N-75¡46'16.2""). Resident people had been noticing the bleaching since about 1-2 weeks before my arrival, associated with extremely warm, and possibly quite brackish waters (from nearby river discharges).<br>
Almost all corals were totally white to pale yellow. Some massive star coral colonies (Montastraea annularis and M. faveolata) still had slightly colored basal patches. Brain coral species (Diploria and Colpophyllia) were completely bleached. Porites porites beds were totally white. P. astreoides knobs were from white to light lemon yellow. Siderastrea siderea was less affected with a dark bluish-violet color in several colonies, and a few normally brown. S. radians was apparently not affected (hard to tell, the small encrustations of this species being normally so light). Even Favia fragum golfball corals were fully bleached. Benthic, rubble-dwelling anemones (probably corallymorpharians) were white. Millepora spp. had both white, normal and ""pinto"" (patchy) like colonies-branches. Did not see any Acropora to tell whether the few remaining colonies bleached or not.<br>

It seemed that deeper corals were less bleached. However, Jaime Rojas, biologist working for both the National Park authorities and the Oceanarium, undertook on July 8 a quick survey around the islands confirming that the phenomenon is widespread. He is making a follow up, and working with daily sea-surface temperature data (possibly salinity too) taken regularly at the Oceanarium. Later on he may make a more detailed report. <br> 
No sponges had bleached. Even brown encrusting Cliona, which harbor zooxanthellae, were fine. <br>

Virgin Islands (U.S.),St. John,,18.3400,-64.7470,8,2005,,3,,NA,,,Caroline S Rogers [caroline_rogers@usgs.gov] in Coral List 1/10/2005,,,"There is now severe bleaching of most of the coral species on the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands. <br>
Bleaching was first noted on Millepora, Agaricia, and the zoanthid Palythoa
beginning in August.  In the last 2 weeks, the bleaching has become more
extensive. The major reef building or common coral species affected
include:

Montastraea annularis, M.faveolata, M. franksi, Porites astreoides, Porites
porites, Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, and D. strigosa.
Acropora palmata, Acropora cervicornis, Dendrogyra cylindrus and M.
cavernosa are exhibiting less bleaching.

Mean water temperatures (at depth) for August and September are the highest
recorded in 15 years of temperature monitoring.  Water temperatures from a
site at 16 m have been over 30 C since September 5th, reaching a maximum on
of 30.8 on September 26.",,1
Puerto Rico,Palominitos Island,,18.3490,-65.5770,8,2005,5 to 22m,1,,NA,,Dive,Edwin Hernandez [coral_giac@yahoo.com] in Coral List 24/8/2005,,,"During a recent dive (August 19, 2005) at Palominitos
Island (6 km off northeastern PR) we documented
bleaching on the following species:<br>
Montastraea annularis, Montastraea faveolata, Montastraea franksi, Siderastrea siderea, Siderastrea radians, Meandrina meandrites, Stephanocoenia intersepta, Leptoseris cucullata, Agaricia agaricites, Agaricia fragilis, Agaricia humilis, Porites astreoides, Porites porites, Porites furcata, Millepora complanata, Millepora alcicornis and 
Erythropodium caribbaeorum (encrusting gorgonian).
<br>Bleaching was observed at depths ranging from 5 to 22
m. Most of the colonies were only partially bleached
(i.e., some moderate color loss, or patchy bleaching).
However, there were colonies that were totally
bleached. Most bleaching occurred on surfaces facing
sunlight.<br>",,1

Random transect monitoring began in 2005. <br>
Mean Coral Cover = 24.7%. <br>
Measured 90.2% bleached coral in September 2005. <br>

Report on 11/5/2005 <br>
During monitoring in response to the bleaching event within the US Virgin
Islands, we've noticed a dramatic increase in the coloration (trend to
normal color) of corals within our study reefs around St. John.  This has
happened within the past 10 - 14 days.  Most corals have at least some
light color (as opposed to white), and some have gradients from pale to
full normal color.  No single species seems to be changing color more
rapidly than any other. Depths of our monitoring sites are between 15-60
ft (4.6-8.3 m).<br>

The mean seawater temperature (55 ft/16.8 m) at a monitoring site at
Tektite Reef went from 30.4¼ C (86.7¼ F) in September to 29.6¼ C (85.3¼ F)
in October.<br>

October was a very rainy and cloudy month.  During the period 9/30 -
10/11, 11.04 inches (28 cm) of rain were recorded while the seawater
temperature at a monitoring site (depth 55 ft/16.8 m) dropped 1.6 ¼C (~3
¼F). <br>

Widespread coral bleaching observed at Buck Island, St. Croix, US Virgin Islands, October 2005.  http://ccma.nos.noaa.gov/products/biogeography/coral_bleaching/welcome.html",,,"During October 16-30, 2005, bleaching was observed in 53% of corals at 91 of 94 randomly selected sites raging in depth between 9 and 91 ft  (2.7 and 27.5 m). Twelve coral species had bleaching greater than 50%, with four species being more than 90% bleached (Diploria labrynthiformis, Agaricia spp., Mycetophyllia spp., and Montastraea annularis). <br>
Several abundant corals also were severely bleached; four corals (M. annularis, D. strigosa, Porites astreoides, and Agaracia spp.) had cover greater than 9,850 cm 2 and experienced bleaching from 40 Ð 95%. Fire corals (Millepora spp.) comprised 11,400 cm 2 of total cover and were bleached 60%. Acropora palmata covered 21,800 cm 2 of the sampled area but was less severely bleached (23%). <br>
Some corals had bleaching less than 20% (Stephanocoenia. interceptis, Madracis spp., Dichocoenia stokesii, Meandrina meandrites), and other corals had no bleaching (Acropora cervicornis; Diploria cylindricus, Eusmilia spp., and Scolymia spp., <br>
In general, the coral bleaching event was widespread and occurred all around Buck Island but with no obvious spatial patterns. Also, no spatial patterns were observed in the occurrence of bleaching for four abundant coral species. A weak but significant correlation (r 2 = 0.159, P = 0.0023) occurred between overall bleaching and depth, such that corals at shallower sites had higher rates of bleaching than those at deeper sites. If coral bleaching is temperature related, the observed correlation between depth and bleaching suggests that water temperature at depth would be lower than at the surface. However, water temperature, measured with a dive computer (Oceanic ProPlus 2) was not significantly lower at deeper sites than at shallower sites (r 2 = 0.004, P = 0.633, F = 0.230, df = 60). Overall, the water temperature ranged from 82 to 95 oF with a mean = 88.9 ± 0.19 oF (from 27.7 to 35 oC, mean = 31.6 ± 0.1 oC).<br>

D’az et al. for Santa Marta, Colombia (fecha). In this case, however, we have not identified a mechanism such as upwelling, that helps to explain this delay between maximum temperature and bleaching. <br>

Between the 23rd of September and the 4th of October of 2005, during the annual surveys of the GCRMN and CARICOMP, we examined five reefs, two oceanics, at Los Roques Archipelago National Park and three continental reefs at MNP. We surveyed more than 500 colonies between 5 and 12 m depth, and only two colonies were partially bleached (< 5% of their surface).  Sea surface temperature (SST) was
30 ¡C. <br>
By the end of October, SST was also 30 ¡C but we found that 21 ± 4% of the colonies (n = 5 transects) had bleached in Cayo Sombrero (CS) at MNP. Most affected species were: <br>
M. franksi (50%)<br>
M. faveolata (31%)<br>
C. natans (15%)<br>
M. meandrites (100%)<br>
A. agaricites (67%) <br>
hydrocorals Millepora spp (38%).<br>
Of the bleached colonies, 19% were afected in < 10% of their surface, 5% were afected in 10-25% of their surface, 19% in 25-50% of their surface and 60% of the colonies were bleached in 75-100% of their surface. We also observed bleached.colonies of  D. strigosa, M. cavernosa, P. astreoides, C. natans, D. laberyntiformis outside those transects.<br>

By the 13th of November, the SST had dropped to 28.7 ¡C but qualitatively we observed more colonies bleached than the previous two weeks and it seemed more intense in terms of colony whiteness.  Thus, in Cayo Sombrero bleaching did not occur at the maximum SST in july-september, but a month later. <br>

We will keep monitoring this event and hope to report the recovery of the colonies in the next weeks.<br>",,1

shallow waters (<10m) at Bah’a de Nenguange on the 21st of October. A week later, most M. annularis colonies were bleached, showing the classic
bleaching pattern being more intense on top than on the sides, while
Colpophyllia natans colonies were pale. By the 11th of November the
bleaching event became more evident: nearly all colonies of M. annularis
and Porites porites were severely bleached, while most M. faveolata,
Diploria labyrinthiformis, Colpophyllia natans, Porites astreoides,
Siderastrea siderea, Millepora spp., and the zoanthid Palythoa

coral reefs of Bah’a de Taganga, adjacent to the TNNP, however, most P.
astreoides colonies were severely bleached in Taganga, in contrast to
Bahia de Neguange. <br>

It is interesting to note that corals at the TNNP bleached quite late
compared to other reef corals throughout the Caribbean [e.g. reefs at
Islas del Rosario, only 200 k southwest from the TNNP, bleached 4 months
earlier in late June (report by Sven Zea posted in coral list)]. This
might have some relation to the bi-modal seasonal upwelling that occurs in
the area, with upwelling peaks taking place early in the year and by
July-August. <br>

American Samoa,"Nuuuli pool, Tutuila",,-14.2800,-170.7150,10,2005,,1,over 95%,NA,,,"Douglas Fenner, Dept. of Marine & Wildlife Resources, American Samoa (Douglas Fenner [dfenner@blueskynet.as] in Coral list 11/8/2005",,,"Staghorn corals (Acropora formosa = A. muricata) have begun bleaching in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  As of 10/29/05, over 95% of A. formosa in Nuuuli pool, Tutuila, American Samoa are partly bleached.  Mike King reports similar bleaching in Alofau pool, Tutuila.  They recovered from the previous summer's bleaching just 5 months ago.<br>
Some have suggested that due to rising temperatures from global warming, in the future coral reefs may bleach every summer.  This is already happening in the pools of American Samoa.  Because it is a regular, annual event, and there are several possible controls, this offers an opportunity for scientists to plan studies of bleaching instead of having to take advantage of unpredictable opportunities.<br>
For the past two Austral summers, I have recorded the bleaching of three species of staghorn Acropora  (A. formosa, A. pulchra, and A. nobilis) in the fringing reef pools of Tutuila, American Samoa.  Acopora formosa and Porites cylindrica dominate the pools of Tutuila, but P. cylindrica was not observed to bleach.  Bleaching of the three staghorns has reached as high as 100 percent of the colonies in some of the pools, with colonies nearly entirely white.  At the same time, very few corals on the outer reef slopes were observed bleaching.  Acropora nobilis is present on the outer slopes (though not common), and did not bleach there when the same species strongly bleached in the pools.  The pools reach higher temperatures than on the outer slopes.  Most of the pools had peak temperatures of 32-33 oC in the last summer, but one hit a peak of 34.9 oC (for a half hour).  The highest temperatures occur on sunny summer days when low tide is midday, reducing circulation.  High temperatures are well known in the pools of nearby Ofu island, American Samoa (Craig, Birkeland, and Belliveau, 2001).  Those pools have a higher diversity of corals and less bleaching.<br>
Mass coral bleaching on outer reef slopes was observed by several people in American Samoa in 2002 and 2003, though the time and intensity were not recorded.  At present, about half of all staghorn colonies in the pools are dead.  Essentially none have died in the past two years, so it is likely they died in 2002 and/or 2003, when bleaching was more intense.  Thus, along with the present bleaching, staghorns in the pools have bleached for five years in a row. <br>    
In 2004, staghorns in the pools began to bleach in March, peaked in April, and ended in August.  Bleaching started again in November (04), peaked in the January to April (05) period, and ended at the end of May (05).  Now bleaching has started again at the end of October (05).  Pool staghorns are spending more of the year bleached than recovered, year after year.",,1

Bahamas,San Salvador,,23.9994,-74.5575,11,2005,,-1,,NA,,,John Rollino [John.Rollino@earthtech.com] in Coral list 12/1/2005,,,"During the week of November 20th, 2005, an Earthwatch Institute Research Team ""The Bahamian Reef Survey"" discovered a bleaching event in progress on patch reefs around San Salvador, Bahamas. The bleaching was evident primarily on Agaricia sp., Favia fragum, and Porites sp. (finger corals) - although Porites asteroids, had limited bleaching. Limited bleaching of Montastrea annularis was also observed; however, many coral heads of this species displayed significant blanching. Water quality testing showed physical and chemical parameters were within normal levels at the time.

The Bahamian Reef Survey has collected data since 1992, on the shallow patch reefs surrounding the Island. This bleaching event is the third bleaching event documented on San Salvador in that time period. Initially the data suggest that the bleaching event is similar to a 1995/96 bleaching event in both scope and affected species. While no proximal cause was found for the earlier event, it appears that higher than normal sea temperatures have been involved in precipitating this event.",,1

Initial estimates are that about a quarter to a third of all live corals were bleached, and a smaller proportion had already died.",,1

At present, (August-September) surveys at Puerto Morelos reef show that 41% of the colonies were bleached and 31% of them were completely white.
Surveys were done at a depth of 4-8m.

The number of colonies sampled at each site was over 2000. Almost all scleractinian species showed bleaching signs, as well as some gorgonians, Milleporas and zoanthids.",,1

Water temps. Have been above 29 Celcius since June (Hobo data). I will be conducting disease surveys in mid-November, so if anything like what we saw in 2005 with WPD and YBD outbreaks during and after the massive bleaching occurs here, we will probably have a chance to document this in our permanent survey transects around the island. Croy will be conducting quantitative surveys and tagging colonies in the next days. 

On the other hand, here in Puerto Rico, there are no signs of a bleaching event. Just the usual, a few pale colonies here and there. Same situation observed during our disease surveys last week in Grenada.",,1

Bleaching in Trincomalee in Pigeon Island and Dutch bay was particularly serious. In May 2010 almost all corals in the shallows (up to about 3 m) at these two locations were bleached. So thatÕs in excess of 90% bleaching. Only the shallows to a depth of about 6m was observed. Below 4 m there was partial bleaching. Montipora aequituberculata and some Pocillopora damicornis were not affected even though they in very shallow water of about 1m in depth.,,1

Some of the other songes are also looking a bit poorly, but not to the extent of mortality.  Samples have been retrieved for analysis both heathy and unhealthy looking X. muta.  That said, even heathy looking sponges were snapping off at their bases.  There is also wide spread bleaching, especially at the 23-35ft depth at Speyside, affecting most species(Montastrea faviolata, Siderastrea sidera, S. radians, all Diplorias, M.
Anularis, Millipora, octocorals etc). Speyside's reefs are generally sponge
dominated, but the main reef building coral species are Montastrea
faveolata, Siderastrea sidera, Diploria spp. And Madracis mirabilis.  At
deeper depths, up to 60ft moderate bleaching was observed, and only of
particular species (Meandrina meandrities and Siderastrea sidera).  The
water temperature at this depth was quite warm, with temperature loggers
recording on the reefs at 30ft showing temperatures up to 31 deg C.
 Interestingly some resiliency studies/models indicate that the longer lived
and slower growing species, such as boulder corals (Montastreas and
Siderastrea) are more resilient that branching species (Porities and
Madracis), however very very little bleaching of M. mirabilis was observed.
 M. mirabilis can be found in extensive spreads in Speyside with octocorals,
sponges, boulder and brain corals inter-dispersed.

Thus far the north eastern side of the island is the only location I've been
able to follow up on, but I have received reports of increased bleaching
along the Caribbean coast and south west of the island.

significant coral bleaching around the Cambodian islands of Koh Rong and Koh Rong Samloem. The extent of this bleaching has been severe with many reef sites showing bleaching levels of 90 to 100% across all coral species. These sites were all shallow-water reefs no deeper than 12 meters. The bleaching began in mid-April and reached its peak about 3-4 weeks ago when the water temperatures increased by at least 2??C, bringing surface water temperatures up to 34??C and over. The  start  of  the  rainy  season  last week has brought cooler water temperatures but has also resulted in heavy sedimentation levels, smothering and  killing  off  many of the bleached colonies. Acropora spp. And D. Heliopora colonies have been hit particularly hard but there are some large Porites colonies which seem to be coping with the unusual conditions. With water temperatures dropping back to 31??C, we are hoping to see some colour returning to Cambodia???s reefs! If you would like further information and images of the bleaching event, feel  free to get in touch with me directly or contact Vicki Bush, the Project Scientist in Cambodia at [1]cambodia at coralcay.org.

Results of the monitoring determined the majority Agaricia agaricites colonies were showing signs of bleaching - with many colonies exhibiting bleaching of greater than 75 percent.

Prior to July, most of the transplants had survived over one year and had exhibited new tissue growth. Review of temperature logger data showed water temperatures >30C  in August. Finally, and somewhat curiously, much less algae was observed on the reefs than in previous monitoring efforts and large corals (e.g., Diploria sp., Montastrea sp., etc.) exhibited little, if any, ill effects.

Anecdotal reports from residents on the island indicated that air temperatures in August were the hottest that anyone could remember.
